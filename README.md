## Overview

TimedTask is a lightweight timer task scheduler for Java that provides individual task instances with their own lifecycle management. Each `TimedTask` can be independently started, stopped, and restarted, giving fine-grained control over task execution.

The library supports three execution modes: one-time with optional initial delay, periodic (fixed-rate), and repetitive (fixed-delay).

## Features

- **Individual Task Lifecycle Management**: Each `TimedTask` instance can be independently started, stopped, and restarted, providing fine-grained control over individual task execution.

- **Three Execution Modes**: Supports one-time execution with optional initial delay, periodic (fixed-rate) execution, and repetitive (fixed-delay) execution to cover different scheduling scenarios.

- **Flexible Executor Options**: Provide your own `AbstractTimedTaskExecutor` implementation for full control how tasks shall be executed, or choose between 2 built-in executors:
  -  `TimedTaskThreadExecutor` for individual thread execution (using virtual threads by default) or
  -  `TimedTaskPoolExecutor` for efficient thread pool-based execution.

- **Fluent Builder API**: Intuitive `TimedTaskBuilder` provides a fluent interface for configuring tasks with method chaining for clean and readable task creation.

- **Custom Thread Factory Support**: Configure custom `ThreadFactory` implementations to control thread creation behavior, naming conventions, and thread properties.

- **Built-in Thread Pool Integration**: `TimedTaskPoolExecutor` integrates with `CustomThreadPool` for efficient resource management with configurable behavior.

- **Task State Introspection**: Query task state with `isRunning()` to monitor execution status and coordinate between multiple tasks.

- **Named Tasks**: Assign meaningful names to tasks and their execution threads for easier debugging, logging, and monitoring.

- **Memory-Safe Design**: Architecture encourages weak references and proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks from long-running tasks.

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Tasks can be stopped gracefully, allowing in-flight executions to complete before termination.

## Key Differences from Java's ScheduledExecutorService

### Design Philosophy

Java's `ScheduledExecutorService` is a **service-centric** approach: you create a service (executor) and submit multiple tasks to it. The service manages all tasks collectively, and tasks are represented by `ScheduledFuture` handles that provide limited control.

`TimedTask` follows a **task-centric** approach: each task is an independent, first-class object with its own lifecycle. You can create, start, stop, and restart individual tasks without affecting others. The executor is just a configurable execution strategy.

**Analogy**: `ScheduledExecutorService` is like a job scheduler service where you submit job descriptions. `TimedTask` is like having individual alarm clocks - each one can be independently configured, started, stopped, and reset.

### Specific Differences

#### 1. Task Lifecycle Control

**ScheduledExecutorService**:
- Tasks are submitted to the service and return a `ScheduledFuture`
- To stop a task, you must cancel its `ScheduledFuture`, which cannot be restarted
- Stopping requires keeping track of `ScheduledFuture` references
- Once cancelled, you must resubmit the task to schedule it again
- No straightforward way to temporarily pause and resume a task

```java
// ScheduledExecutorService example
ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
ScheduledFuture<?> future = executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

// To stop
future.cancel(false);

// To restart - must resubmit entirely
future = executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

**TimedTask**:
- Each task is a self-contained object with `start()` and `stop()` methods
- Tasks can be stopped and restarted multiple times
- No need to track separate handles - the task object itself provides control
- Clean, object-oriented lifecycle management

```java
// TimedTask example
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> doWork())
    .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
    .build();

task.start();  // Start execution
task.stop();   // Stop execution
task.start();  // Restart - same configuration
```

#### 2. Execution Timing Semantics

**ScheduledExecutorService**:
- `scheduleAtFixedRate()`: Attempts to maintain fixed rate, but if execution takes longer than the period, subsequent executions may run back-to-back without delay
- `scheduleWithFixedDelay()`: Guarantees delay between completion of one execution and start of next
- Distinction between rate and delay is method-based
- No built-in support for one-time execution with initial delay followed by different scheduling

**TimedTask**:
- **Periodic mode** (via `setPeriodicDelay()`): Similar to `scheduleAtFixedRate()` - schedules next execution at fixed intervals from the start time, **regardless of task execution duration**
- **Repetitive mode** (via `setRepetetiveDelay()`): Similar to `scheduleWithFixedDelay()` - waits for task completion before scheduling next execution with the specified delay
- **One-time mode**: When neither periodic nor repetitive delay is set, task executes once after initial delay
- All modes support optional `setInitialDelay()` for consistent delayed start behavior
- Mode is configuration-based rather than method-based

```java
// Periodic: Fixed-rate execution
TimedTask periodic = executor.createTimedTask(t -> doWork())
    .setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
    .build();

// Repetitive: Fixed-delay execution
TimedTask repetitive = executor.createTimedTask(t -> doWork())
    .setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .setRepetetiveDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
    .build();

// One-time: Single execution after delay
TimedTask oneTime = executor.createTimedTask(t -> doWork())
    .setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .build();
```

#### 3. Execution Model

**ScheduledExecutorService**:
- Centralized thread pool manages all scheduled tasks
- Tasks share a common thread pool with fixed or cached sizing
- Limited control over thread creation per task
- Thread pool configuration applies to all tasks uniformly
- Tasks are executed on pool threads, thread naming controlled by pool's ThreadFactory

**TimedTask**:
- Flexible executor abstraction via `AbstractTimedTaskExecutor`.
- Built-in **`TimedTaskThreadExecutor`**: Each timer gets its own dedicated thread (virtual threads by default), with configurable `ThreadFactory`.
- Built-in **`TimedTaskPoolExecutor`**: Tasks share a thread pool (uses `CustomThreadPool` internally). Similar to the `ScheduledExecutorService`.
- Each task can theoretically use a different executor.
- Named tasks automatically propagate names to their execution threads for better debugging.

```java
// Option 1: Individual threads per task (virtual threads by default)
TimedTaskThreadExecutor threadExec = new TimedTaskThreadExecutor();
TimedTask task1 = threadExec.createTimedTask(t -> doWork())
    .setName("DatabaseSync")
    .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
    .build();

// Option 2: Shared thread pool
TimedTaskPoolExecutor poolExec = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("MyTaskPool");
TimedTask task2 = poolExec.createTimedTask(t -> doWork())
    .setName("CacheCleanup")
    .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
    .build();

// Option 3: Custom executor implementation
AbstractTimedTaskExecutor customExec = new MyCustomExecutor();
```

#### 4. Resource Management

**ScheduledExecutorService**:
- Executor service owns and manages thread resources
- Must call `shutdown()` or `shutdownNow()` on the executor service to release resources
- Cancelling individual tasks doesn't release thread pool resources
- Thread pool continues to consume resources until explicitly shut down
- Memory leaks possible if strong references kept in task closures

**TimedTask**:
- Executor is separate from individual task lifecycle
- Stopping a task releases its specific execution thread (in `TimedTaskThreadExecutor` mode)
- Thread pool executors can be shut down independently: `poolExecutor.shutdown()`
- Architecture explicitly encourages weak references to prevent memory leaks
- Builder pattern creates defensive copies of `Duration` objects to prevent external reference retention
- Timer thread and task execution threads are separate, allowing fine-grained resource control

```java
// Warning in JavaDoc: Avoid strong references to external objects
// Use WeakReference for long-lived external objects
WeakReference<MyService> serviceRef = new WeakReference<>(myService);
// TimedTask resource management
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    MyService service = serviceRef.get();
    if (service != null) {
        service.doWork();
    }
}).build();

task.start();
// ... later
task.stop();  // Releases timer thread resources immediately

// For pool executors, shutdown the pool when done
poolExecutor.shutdown();
```

#### 5. Task Control and Introspection

**ScheduledExecutorService**:
- Limited state introspection and self control.

**TimedTask**:
- **Public API**: `isRunning()` method provides clear boolean state - `true` when timer is currently scheduled, `false` when stopped
- **Self-Reference**: Tasks receive reference to themselves (`Consumer<TimedTask>`), enabling self-introspection and self-control
- **Self-Stopping**: Tasks can stop themselves based on internal logic or conditions
- **Named Tasks**: Optional naming propagates to execution threads for debugging:
  - Timer thread: `[TaskName]Timer`
  - Task execution threads: `[TaskName]Task#1`, `[TaskName]Task#2`, etc.
- **Simple State Model**: Two states only - `RUNNING` or `NOT_RUNNING` - easy to understand and use

```java
// TimedTask - rich introspection and self-control
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // Task can introspect its own state
    if (t.isRunning()) {
        System.out.println("Task is actively scheduled");
    }

    // Perform work
    processData();

    // Task can stop itself based on conditions
    if (shouldStopCondition()) {
        System.out.println("Stopping task from within");
        t.stop();
    }
})
.setName("DataProcessor")
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
.build();

// Start the task
task.start();

// External monitoring - simple and clear
if (task.isRunning()) {
    System.out.println("Task is active and scheduled");
} else {
    System.out.println("Task is stopped");
}

// Later - stop from outside
task.stop();

// Restart if needed
if (!task.isRunning()) {
    task.start();
}
```

**Key Advantages of TimedTask**:

1. **Bidirectional Control**: Tasks can be controlled both externally (via `start()`/`stop()`) and internally (task can call `stop()` on itself)

2. **Simple State Querying**: Single `isRunning()` method covers all needs - no confusion between "done", "cancelled", or "running"

3. **Self-Aware Tasks**: The `Consumer<TimedTask>` pattern enables tasks to make decisions based on their own state

4. **Debugging Support**: Named tasks with automatic thread naming make it easy to identify tasks in thread dumps and logs

### When to Use Each

**Use ScheduledExecutorService when**:
- You need a simple, standard solution for task scheduling
- Tasks are fire-and-forget with no need for individual lifecycle control
- You prefer working with `Future`-based APIs
- You're integrating with existing executor-based frameworks

**Use TimedTask when**:
- You need fine-grained control over individual task lifecycles
- Tasks need to be dynamically started, stopped, and restarted
- You want tasks to introspect or control themselves
- You need flexibility in choosing between dedicated threads or thread pools
- You want better debugging support with named tasks and threads

## Architecture

### Core Components

The TimedTask library is built around a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns between task definition, execution strategy, and lifecycle management. The design follows object-oriented principles with well-defined responsibilities for each component.

#### 1. TimedTask

The `TimedTask` class is the central component representing an individual scheduled task. It encapsulates:

- **Task Logic**: Stores the user-defined task as a `Consumer<TimedTask>`, allowing tasks to receive a reference to themselves for introspection and self-control.

- **Lifecycle State**: Maintains an internal state machine with two states:
  - `RUNNING`: Task is actively scheduled and executing
  - `NOT_RUNNING`: Task is stopped

- **Timing Configuration**: Holds three optional `Duration` fields:
  - `initialDelay`: Delay before the first execution
  - `periodicDelay`: Fixed-rate interval between execution starts (scheduled at fixed intervals)
  - `repetetiveDelay`: Fixed-delay interval after execution completion

- **Internal Timer**: Contains a nested `Timer` class that manages the scheduling logic on a dedicated timer thread.

- **Execution Control**: Provides thread-safe `start()` and `stop()` methods for lifecycle management, plus `isRunning()` for state introspection.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Defensive copying of `Duration` objects to prevent external reference retention
- Separation of timer thread (scheduling) from task execution thread(s)
- Self-reference pattern enables tasks to introspect and control themselves
- Synchronization mechanisms prevent race conditions during state transitions

#### 2. TimedTaskBuilder

The `TimedTaskBuilder` class implements the Builder pattern for fluent, type-safe task configuration. It:

- **Enforces Required Parameters**: Mandates `Consumer<TimedTask>` task and `AbstractTimedTaskExecutor` at construction
- **Provides Fluent API**: Method chaining for optional parameters (`setInitialDelay()`, `setPeriodicDelay()`, `setRepetetiveDelay()`, `setName()`)
- **Validates Configuration**: Ensures mutually exclusive execution modes (periodic vs. repetitive)
- **Prevents Memory Leaks**: Creates defensive copies of all `Duration` and `String` parameters to decouple from external references
- **Builds Immutable Tasks**: Constructs fully configured `TimedTask` instances via `build()`

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Fluent API improves readability and reduces configuration errors
- Defensive copying prevents unintended object retention
- Validation logic centralized in builder rather than scattered across `TimedTask`
- Builder pattern separates task configuration from task execution concerns

#### 3. AbstractTimedTaskExecutor

The `AbstractTimedTaskExecutor` is an abstract base class that defines the execution strategy pattern.

- **Factory for Builders**: Provides `createTimedTask(Consumer<TimedTask>)` to create `TimedTaskBuilder` instances
- **Execution Abstraction**: Declares two abstract methods for execution:
  - `run(Runnable task)`: Execute task without naming
  - `run(Runnable task, String name)`: Execute task with thread naming support
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows different execution implementations without changing `TimedTask` code

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Abstract class (not interface) allows adding common functionality in future without breaking implementations
- Two `run()` variants support both anonymous and named task execution
- Factory method pattern centralizes builder creation logic

#### 4. TimedTaskThreadExecutor

`TimedTaskThreadExecutor` is a concrete executor that creates individual threads for each task.

- **Per-Task Threading**: Each `run()` call creates a new thread via the configured `ThreadFactory`
- **Virtual Thread Default**: Uses `Thread.ofVirtual().factory()` by default for lightweight thread creation
- **Configurable ThreadFactory**: Allows custom thread factories via `setThreadFactory(ThreadFactory)`
- **Thread Naming Support**: Implements named execution by setting thread names before starting

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Virtual threads by default minimize resource overhead for many concurrent tasks
- ThreadFactory pattern allows full control over thread creation (daemon status, priorities, etc.)
- Immediate thread start ensures consistent behavior
- Suitable for tasks that need isolation or have their own lifecycle requirements

#### 5. TimedTaskPoolExecutor

`TimedTaskPoolExecutor` is a concrete executor that uses a shared thread pool for task execution.

- **Thread Pool Integration**: Uses external `CustomThreadPool`
- **Configurable Construction**: Offers three constructors:
  - Default: Minimum 0 threads, 60-second idle time
  - Named: Same as default with pool name
  - Custom: Accepts any `AbstractExecutorService` implementation
- **Task Submission**: Submits tasks to the pool rather than creating new threads
- **Lifecycle Management**: Provides `shutdown()` method to gracefully terminate the pool

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Default configuration (0 minimum threads) allows pool to scale down when idle
- Integration with `CustomThreadPool` provides advanced features like dynamic sizing
- Accepting `AbstractExecutorService` allows integration with any Java executor
- Currently doesn't propagate task names to thread pool (noted as limitation)
- Suitable for many tasks sharing limited thread resources

```

#### Interaction Flow Details

**1. Executor Selection**
- User creates an executor instance (`TimedTaskThreadExecutor` or `TimedTaskPoolExecutor`)
- Optionally configures executor (e.g., custom `ThreadFactory` or thread pool settings)

**2. Task Creation**
- User calls `executor.createTimedTask(task)` passing a `Consumer<TimedTask>`
- Executor returns a `TimedTaskBuilder` pre-configured with the executor reference

**3. Task Configuration**
- User chains builder methods to configure task parameters
- Builder validates and stores configuration (with defensive copying)
- Periodic and repetitive delays are mutually exclusive

**4. Task Building**
- User calls `build()` to construct the `TimedTask`
- Builder creates `TimedTask` instance and applies all configuration
- `TimedTask` starts in `NOT_RUNNING` state

**5. Task Activation**
- User calls `task.start()`
- `TimedTask` transitions to `RUNNING` state
- Initial execution time is calculated (now + initialDelay)

**6. Timer Thread Creation**
- `TimedTask` delegates to executor to spawn timer thread
- Timer thread is named `[TaskName]Timer` if task has a name
- Timer thread enters scheduling loop

**7. Task Execution Loop**
- **Timer thread** continuously:
  - Checks if current time >= next execution time
  - For **periodic mode**: Calculates next execution time immediately (fixed-rate)
  - Delegates actual task execution to executor
  - For **repetitive mode**: Waits for task completion to calculate next execution time (fixed-delay)
  - For **one-time mode**: Stops after single execution

- **Executor** creates execution thread(s):
  - Thread named `[TaskName]Task#N` where N is execution count
  - Executes user's `Consumer<TimedTask>`, passing task reference
  - Task can call `stop()` on itself if needed

**8. Task Deactivation**
- User calls `task.stop()` (or task calls `stop()` on itself)
- Task transitions to `NOT_RUNNING` state
- Timer thread detects state change and terminates gracefully
- Execution threads complete their current run and terminate

**9. Task Reactivation**
- Task can be restarted with `task.start()`
- Returns to step 5 with same configuration
- Execution count continues incrementing

#### Thread Model

The architecture employs a **dual-thread model** for each running task:

1. **Timer Thread** (1 per task)
   - Dedicated to scheduling logic
   - Runs continuously while task is in `RUNNING` state
   - Sleeps/waits between executions
   - Minimal resource consumption

2. **Execution Thread(s)** (variable per task)
   - Created on-demand for each task execution
   - For `TimedTaskThreadExecutor`: New thread per execution (virtual threads by default)
   - For `TimedTaskPoolExecutor`: Drawn from shared thread pool
   - Executes user task code
   - Terminates after task completion

This separation ensures:
- Timer precision is not affected by long-running task executions
- Tasks can run concurrently with their own scheduling
- Clean resource cleanup when tasks are stopped

#### Synchronization and Thread Safety

The architecture employs multiple synchronization mechanisms:

1. **State Transitions**: `start()` and `stop()` are `synchronized` to prevent race conditions
2. **Execution Lock**: Internal `executionLock` coordinates between timer and execution threads
3. **Volatile State**: Task state is `volatile` for visibility across threads
4. **Atomic Next Execution**: Next execution time updates are synchronized with notification
5. **Interrupt Handling**: Proper interrupt handling for graceful shutdown

#### Memory Management Strategy

The architecture is designed to prevent memory leaks through:

1. **Defensive Copying**: All `Duration` and `String` parameters are copied to prevent external reference chains
2. **Weak Reference Encouragement**: JavaDoc explicitly warns against strong references in task closures
3. **Thread Lifecycle**: Threads are created with task-scoped lifetimes and terminate properly
4. **No Thread Caching**: Timer threads are created per-task and released on stop
5. **Optional Pooling**: Pool executor allows resource sharing when appropriate

This design ensures that stopping a task releases all associated resources, preventing long-term memory retention.

## Usage Guide

### Creating a TimedTask

TimedTask uses a fluent builder pattern for task creation. The process involves three steps:

1. **Choose an executor** - Decide between individual threads, a thread pool or a custom executor
2. **Configure the task** - Set timing parameters and optional name
3. **Build and start** - Create the task instance and start execution

#### Using TimedTaskThreadExecutor

`TimedTaskThreadExecutor` creates a dedicated thread for each task execution. By default, it uses Java's virtual threads, making it efficient even for many concurrent tasks.

**Basic Example:**

```java
// Create the executor (uses virtual threads by default)
TimedTaskThreadExecutor executor = new TimedTaskThreadExecutor();

// Create and configure a task
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed!");
})
.setName("MyTask")
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.build();

// Start the task
task.start();
```

**With Custom ThreadFactory:**

```java
// Create executor with custom thread factory
TimedTaskThreadExecutor executor = new TimedTaskThreadExecutor();
executor.setThreadFactory(r -> {
    Thread thread = new Thread(r);
    thread.setDaemon(true);
    thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
    return thread;
});

// Create task
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // High-priority daemon thread execution
    performCriticalWork();
})
.build();
```

**When to use:**
- Tasks need isolation from each other
- Different tasks need different thread configurations
- Resource consumption is not a concern (virtual threads are lightweight)
- You want automatic thread cleanup when tasks stop

#### Using TimedTaskPoolExecutor

`TimedTaskPoolExecutor` uses a shared thread pool to execute tasks, making it more efficient when you have many tasks competing for limited resources.

**Basic Example:**

```java
// Create pool executor with default settings
// (0 minimum threads, 60-second idle time)
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("MyTaskPool");

// Create multiple tasks sharing the pool
TimedTask task1 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    processData();
})
.setName("DataProcessor")
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(1))
.build();

TimedTask task2 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    cleanupCache();
})
.setName("CacheCleanup")
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
.build();

// Start both tasks
task1.start();
task2.start();

// Later: shutdown the pool when all tasks are done
task1.stop();
task2.stop();
executor.shutdown();
```

**With Custom Thread Pool:**

```java
// Create custom thread pool with specific configuration
CustomThreadPool customPool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setMinThreads(2)
    .setMaxThreads(10)
    .setIdleTime(Duration.ofMinutes(2))
    .setName("CustomTaskPool")
    .build();

// Create executor with custom pool
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(customPool);

// Use the executor
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    performWork();
})
.build();
```

**When to use:**
- You have many tasks and want to limit total thread count
- Tasks are short-lived and can share thread resources
- You need centralized thread pool management
- Memory efficiency is a priority

**Important Notes:**
- Currently, task names are not propagated to pool threads (limitation noted)
- Remember to call `shutdown()` on the pool executor when done
- The pool scales down automatically when threads are idle

### Execution Modes

TimedTask supports three distinct execution modes, configured through the builder API. The mode is determined by which delay methods you call on the builder.

#### One-Time Execution with Initial Delay

A one-time task executes exactly once after an optional initial delay, then automatically stops.

**Configuration:**
- Set only `setInitialDelay()` (or set neither delay)
- Do not set `setPeriodicDelay()` or `setRepetetiveDelay()`

**Example:**

```java
// Execute once immediately
TimedTask immediate = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    System.out.println("Executed immediately");
})
.build();

immediate.start();
// Executes once, then task automatically stops

// Execute once after 5 seconds
TimedTask delayed = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    System.out.println("Executed after 5 seconds");
})
.setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.build();

delayed.start();
// Waits 5 seconds, executes once, then stops
```

**Behavior:**
- Task transitions to `NOT_RUNNING` state after execution
- Can be restarted with `start()` to execute again
- Timer thread terminates after execution

#### Periodic Execution (Fixed-Rate)

Periodic execution schedules tasks at **fixed intervals from the start time**, similar to `ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate()`. The next execution is scheduled immediately when the current execution starts, regardless of how long the execution takes.

**Configuration:**
- Call `setPeriodicDelay(Duration)` on the builder
- Optionally add `setInitialDelay()` for delayed start

**Example:**

```java
// Execute every 10 seconds, starting immediately
TimedTask periodic = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    performPeriodicCheck();
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
.build();

periodic.start();

// Execute every 1 minute with 30-second initial delay
TimedTask delayedPeriodic = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    syncData();
})
.setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(1))
.build();

delayedPeriodic.start();
```

**Timing Behavior:**

```
Time:    0s    10s   20s   30s   40s   50s   60s
         |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Execute: X     X     X     X     X     X     X
         ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑
         └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
         Fixed 10-second intervals


Time:    0s    10s   20s   30s
         |-----|-----|-----|
Execute: X===  |     |     |
               X========== |
                     X==   |
                           X===

         triggers at fixed intervals
```

**Important Characteristics:**
- **Fixed schedule**: Next execution scheduled based on start time, not completion time
- **No drift**: Long-term scheduling stays accurate (no cumulative timing errors)
- **Overlap possible**: If execution takes longer than the period, executions may overlap (multiple tasks running simultaneously)

**When to use:**
- You need predictable, fixed-rate execution
- Timing accuracy is important
- Task duration is generally shorter than the period
- Occasional overlapping executions are acceptable

#### Repetitive Execution (Fixed-Delay)

Repetitive execution schedules the next execution **after the previous execution completes**, similar to `ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay()`. This guarantees a specific delay between task completions and starts.

**Configuration:**
- Call `setRepetetiveDelay(Duration)` on the builder
- Optionally add `setInitialDelay()` for delayed start

**Example:**

```java
// Execute with 5-second delay after each completion
TimedTask repetitive = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    processQueue(); // May take variable time
})
.setRepetetiveDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.build();

repetitive.start();

// Execute with 10-second initial delay, then 30-second delays between completions
TimedTask delayedRepetitive = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    performMaintenance();
})
.setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
.setRepetetiveDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
.build();

delayedRepetitive.start();
```

**Timing Behavior:**

```
Time:    0s  3s    8s 10s   15s 18s   23s
         |---|-----|--|-----|---|-----|-|-----
Execute: X===|     X==|     X===|     X=|
         └─┬─┘     └┬─┘     └─┬─┘     └┬┘
         3s│   5s   │2s 5s  3s│   5s   │1s  5s
         exe delay exe delay exe delay exe delay

Next execution = completion time + 5s delay
```

**Important Characteristics:**
- **Completion-based**: Next execution scheduled only after current execution finishes
- **No overlap**: Tasks never overlap; each execution completes before the next starts
- **Variable intervals**: Total time between starts = execution time + delay
- **Self-throttling**: Automatically adjusts to task execution time

**When to use:**
- Tasks have variable execution times
- You must prevent overlapping executions
- You need guaranteed rest period between tasks
- Task execution time may occasionally exceed desired period

#### Choosing Between Periodic and Repetitive

| Aspect | Periodic (Fixed-Rate) | Repetitive (Fixed-Delay) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Next execution** | Scheduled from start time | Scheduled from completion time |
| **Interval basis** | Fixed intervals | Completion + delay |
| **Can overlap** | Yes | No |
| **Drift** | No cumulative drift | Potential drift over time |
| **Variable execution** | May cause overlaps | Automatically accommodates |
| **Best for** | Regular schedules | Variable-duration tasks |

### Executor Types

TimedTask provides two built-in executor implementations, each optimized for different use cases. You can also create custom executors by extending `AbstractTimedTaskExecutor`.

#### TimedTaskThreadExecutor

`TimedTaskThreadExecutor` creates **individual threads** for each task execution, providing complete isolation between tasks.

**Key Features:**

- **Virtual Threads by Default**: Uses `Thread.ofVirtual().factory()`, making it efficient even with many concurrent tasks
- **Custom ThreadFactory Support**: Configure thread properties (daemon status, priority, naming, etc.)
- **Automatic Thread Naming**: Named tasks automatically name their threads as `[TaskName]Timer` and `[TaskName]Task#N`
- **Immediate Cleanup**: Stopping a task immediately releases its threads
- **Thread Isolation**: Each task execution gets its own thread, preventing interference

**Configuration:**

```java
// Default configuration (virtual threads)
TimedTaskThreadExecutor executor = new TimedTaskThreadExecutor();

// Custom thread factory for platform threads
ThreadFactory customFactory = r -> {
    Thread thread = new Thread(r);
    thread.setDaemon(true);
    thread.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY);
    return thread;
};
executor.setThreadFactory(customFactory);

// Custom factory with thread naming
ThreadFactory namedFactory = r -> {
    Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().factory().newThread(r);
    thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> {
        System.err.println("Exception in " + t.getName() + ": " + e.getMessage());
    });
    return thread;
};
executor.setThreadFactory(namedFactory);
```

**Resource Model:**

Each running task creates:
- **1 timer thread**: Dedicated to scheduling logic
- **N execution threads**: One per execution (created on-demand)

**Advantages:**
- Simple and predictable resource model
- Complete task isolation
- Easy debugging with individual threads
- No contention between tasks
- Automatic cleanup on task stop

**Considerations:**
- More threads than pool-based approach (mitigated by virtual threads)
- Each task manages its own threads independently
- Better for long-running or resource-intensive tasks

**Best Used For:**
- Tasks requiring isolation
- Long-running task executions
- Tasks with different thread requirements
- When thread count is not a concern (virtual threads)
- Development and debugging (clearer thread dumps)

#### TimedTaskPoolExecutor

`TimedTaskPoolExecutor` uses a **shared thread pool** to execute tasks, optimizing resource usage when many tasks compete for limited threads.

**Key Features:**

- **Shared Resource Pool**: Multiple tasks share a common thread pool
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Pool grows and shrinks based on demand
- **Configurable Sizing**: Control minimum threads, maximum threads, and idle time
- **CustomThreadPool Integration**: Uses the `CustomThreadPool` implementation
- **Graceful Shutdown**: `shutdown()` method for clean termination

**Configuration:**

```java
// Default: 0 minimum threads, 60-second idle time
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor();

// Named pool (useful for monitoring)
TimedTaskPoolExecutor namedExecutor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("MyAppTasks");

// Custom pool configuration
CustomThreadPool customPool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setMinThreads(4)           // Always keep 4 threads alive
    .setMaxThreads(20)          // Scale up to 20 threads
    .setIdleTime(Duration.ofMinutes(5))  // Kill idle threads after 5 minutes
    .setName("TaskExecutionPool")
    .build();

TimedTaskPoolExecutor poolExecutor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(customPool);

// Using any AbstractExecutorService
ExecutorService javaExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
TimedTaskPoolExecutor javaPoolExecutor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(javaExecutor);
```

**Resource Model:**

- **Timer threads**: Each task draws one timer thread from the pool while in `RUNNING` state
- **Execution threads**: Drawn from shared pool, reused across all tasks
- **Pool sizing**: Dynamically adjusted based on configuration and demand

**Thread Pool Lifecycle:**

```java
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("MyPool");

// Create and start multiple tasks
TimedTask task1 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> work1()).build();
TimedTask task2 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> work2()).build();
task1.start();
task2.start();

// Stop individual tasks (timer threads released, pool threads returned to pool)
task1.stop();
task2.stop();

// Shutdown pool when completely done
executor.shutdown();  // Initiates graceful shutdown
```

**Advantages:**
- Efficient resource usage with many tasks
- Bounded thread creation
- Centralized thread management
- Reuses threads across task executions
- Better for systems with thread count limits

**Considerations:**
- Task names currently not propagated to pool threads (known limitation)
- Shared pool means tasks can affect each other's performance ⚠️
- Must remember to shutdown pool when done

**Best Used For:**
- Many concurrent tasks
- Short-lived task executions
- Memory-constrained environments
- Systems with thread count limits
- Production deployments with resource management

#### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | TimedTaskThreadExecutor | TimedTaskPoolExecutor |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Thread Model** | Individual threads per execution | Shared thread pool |
| **Default Thread Type** | Virtual threads | Depends on pool configuration |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Lower (more threads) | Higher (shared resources) |
| **Task Isolation** | Complete | Partial (shared pool) |
| **Thread Naming** | Automatic | Manual via ThreadFactory |
| **Cleanup** | Automatic on task stop | Requires pool shutdown |
| **Scalability** | Excellent (virtual threads) | Good (bounded by pool) |
| **Configuration** | ThreadFactory | Pool parameters (including ThreadFactory) |
| **Best For** | Isolation, debugging | Resource efficiency |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |

#### Custom Executors

You can create custom executors by extending `AbstractTimedTaskExecutor`:

```java
public class MyCustomExecutor extends AbstractTimedTaskExecutor {

    @Override
    void run(Runnable task) {
        // Your custom execution logic
        // Example: Log, measure, route to specialized threads, etc.
        System.out.println("Executing task");
        new Thread(task).start();
    }

    @Override
    void run(Runnable task, String name) {
        // Your custom execution logic with naming support
        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        thread.setName(name);
        thread.start();
    }
}

// Use your custom executor
MyCustomExecutor executor = new MyCustomExecutor();
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> doWork()).build();
```

### Controlling Task Lifecycle

TimedTask provides simple, intuitive methods for controlling task execution. Each task is an independent object with its own lifecycle that can be managed without affecting other tasks.

#### Starting Tasks

Use the `start()` method to begin task execution. This transitions the task from `NOT_RUNNING` to `RUNNING` state and spawns the timer thread.

**Start Behavior:**

- **Returns `true`**: Task successfully started
- **Returns `false`**: Task was already running (calling `start()` on a running task has no effect)
- **Immediate effect**: Timer thread created and scheduling begins immediately
- **Initial delay**: If configured, first execution waits for initial delay period

**Example with Initial Delay:**

```java
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    System.out.println("Executed at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
})
.setInitialDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
.build();

System.out.println("Starting at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
task.start();
// Timer starts immediately, but first execution waits 5 seconds
// Output:
// Starting at: 2025-11-06T10:00:00
// Executed at: 2025-11-06T10:00:05  (first execution after 5s)
// Executed at: 2025-11-06T10:00:15  (subsequent executions every 10s)
// Executed at: 2025-11-06T10:00:25
```

**Thread Safety:**

The `start()` method is `synchronized`, making it safe to call from multiple threads.

#### Stopping Tasks

Use the `stop()` method to halt task execution. This transitions the task to `NOT_RUNNING` state and terminates the timer thread gracefully.

**Stop Behavior:**

- **Graceful shutdown**: Timer thread terminates cleanly
- **No return value**: `stop()` is a `void` method (always succeeds)
- **Idempotent**: Calling `stop()` on a stopped task is safe (no effect)
- **Current execution**: Any currently executing task instance completes normally
- **Immediate scheduling halt**: No new executions are scheduled after `stop()`

**Timing of Stop:**

```java
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    System.out.println("Start execution: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    Thread.sleep(3000);  // Simulates long-running work
    System.out.println("End execution: " + LocalDateTime.now());
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.build();

task.start();
Thread.sleep(1000);  // Let task start executing
task.stop();         // Stop while task is executing

// Output:
// Start execution: 10:00:00
// End execution: 10:00:03  <- Execution completes despite stop()
// No further executions occur
```

**Thread Safety:**

The `stop()` method is `synchronized` and thread-safe.

#### Restarting Tasks

Tasks can be restarted after stopping, using the same configuration. Simply call `start()` again.

**Restart Behavior:**

- **Same configuration**: All timing parameters (initial delay, periodic/repetitive delay) are preserved
- **Timing restarts**: Next execution time is recalculated from the restart moment (initial delay applies again)
- **Execution count continues**: The execution counter is not reset and continues incrementing across restarts
- **Initial delay reapplied**: If configured, initial delay applies again on restart
- **Unlimited restarts**: Tasks can be stopped and restarted indefinitely

#### Checking Task State

Use the `isRunning()` method to check if a task is actively running.

**State Check Behavior:**

- **Returns `true`**: Task is in `RUNNING` state (timer thread active)
- **Returns `false`**: Task is in `NOT_RUNNING` state (timer thread terminated)
- **Thread-safe**: Safe to call from any thread
- **Real-time**: Reflects current state accurately

**Coordination Between Tasks:**

```java
TimedTask primaryTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    System.out.println("Primary task running");
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.build();

TimedTask secondaryTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // Secondary task only runs when primary is active
    if (primaryTask.isRunning()) {
        System.out.println("Secondary task running");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Primary stopped, stopping secondary");
        t.stop();  // Stop self
    }
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
.build();

primaryTask.start();
secondaryTask.start();

Thread.sleep(10000);
primaryTask.stop();  // Secondary will detect and stop itself
```

#### Self-Stopping Tasks

Tasks receive a reference to themselves (`Consumer<TimedTask>`), enabling self-introspection and self-control.

**Task Stops Itself After Condition:**

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

TimedTask selfStoppingTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    int count = counter.incrementAndGet();
    System.out.println("Execution #" + count);

    // Stop after 5 executions
    if (count >= 5) {
        System.out.println("Reached limit, stopping");
        t.stop();  // Task stops itself
    }
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
.build();

selfStoppingTask.start();
// Task will run 5 times and then stop automatically
```

**Task Stops on Error Condition:**

```java
TimedTask monitoringTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    if (!checkSystemHealth()) {
        System.err.println("System unhealthy, stopping monitoring");
        t.stop();  // Stop self on error
        return;
    }

    System.out.println("System healthy");
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
.build();

monitoringTask.start();
```

#### Lifecycle Summary

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Task Created   │
│  (NOT_RUNNING)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ start() → returns true
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Task Running   │
│   (RUNNING)     │◄────┐
└────────┬────────┘     │
         │              │
         │ stop()       │ start() → returns true
         │              │ (restart)
         ▼              │
┌─────────────────┐     │
│  Task Stopped   │     │
│  (NOT_RUNNING)  │─────┘
└─────────────────┘

Note: start() on RUNNING task returns false (no state change)
      stop() on NOT_RUNNING task has no effect (idempotent)
```

**Key Lifecycle Points:**

1. **Creation**: Task starts in `NOT_RUNNING` state
2. **Start**: Transitions to `RUNNING`, starts timer runnable
3. **Running**: Task executes according to configuration
4. **Stop**: Transitions to `NOT_RUNNING`, terminates timer runnable
5. **Restart**: Can repeat start-stop cycle indefinitely
6. **Self-stop**: Task can stop itself from within execution
7. **One-time**: Automatically stops after single execution (if no periodic/repetitive delay)

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Thread Factories

`TimedTaskThreadExecutor` allows you to customize thread creation behavior through the `ThreadFactory` interface. This provides fine-grained control over thread properties and behavior.

```java
ThreadFactory namedThreadFactory = new ThreadFactory() {
    private final AtomicInteger threadNumber = new AtomicInteger(1);

    @Override
    public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
        Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().factory().newThread(r);
        thread.setName("MyApp-Worker-" + threadNumber.getAndIncrement());
        return thread;
    }
};

executor.setThreadFactory(namedThreadFactory);
// Threads will be named: MyApp-Worker-1, MyApp-Worker-2, etc.
```

### Working with Thread Pools

`TimedTaskPoolExecutor` provides flexible thread pool configuration through `CustomThreadPool` or any `AbstractExecutorService` implementation.

#### Understanding Thread Pool Configuration

Thread pools in TimedTask (via `CustomThreadPool`) are configured with three main parameters:

- **Minimum Threads**: Core threads that stay alive even when idle
- **Maximum Threads**: Upper bound on total threads (determined by `CustomThreadPool`)
- **Idle Time**: How long threads wait for work before terminating

#### Default Pool Configuration

The default `TimedTaskPoolExecutor` constructor creates a pool optimized for dynamic scaling:

```java
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor();
// Equivalent to:
// - Minimum threads: 0 (no threads kept alive when idle)
// - Idle time: 60 seconds (threads terminate after 60s of inactivity)
```

**Behavior:**
- Pool starts with zero threads
- Threads created on demand when tasks execute
- Idle threads terminate after 60 seconds
- Pool scales down to zero when all threads are idle
- Memory efficient for intermittent task execution

#### Custom Pool Configurations

**Always-Ready Pool (Minimum Threads):**

```java
CustomThreadPool pool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setMinThreads(4)  // Always keep 4 threads alive
    .setIdleTime(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
    .setName("AlwaysReadyPool")
    .build();

TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(pool);
```

#### Named Thread Pools

Naming pools helps with monitoring, debugging, and thread dump analysis:

```java
// Simple named pool
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("BackgroundTasks");

// Custom named pool
CustomThreadPool pool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setName("DataSyncPool")
    .setMinThreads(2)
    .setIdleTime(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
    .build();

TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(pool);
```

Threads in the pool will have names based on the pool name, making them easy to identify in monitoring tools.

#### Using Standard Java Executors

`TimedTaskPoolExecutor` accepts any `AbstractExecutorService`:

```java
// Fixed thread pool
ExecutorService fixedPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8);
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(fixedPool);

// Cached thread pool
ExecutorService cachedPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
TimedTaskPoolExecutor cachedExecutor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(cachedPool);

// Scheduled executor (for integration)
ScheduledExecutorService scheduledPool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(4);
TimedTaskPoolExecutor scheduledExecutor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(scheduledPool);

// Work-stealing pool (Java 8+)
ExecutorService workStealingPool = Executors.newWorkStealingPool();
TimedTaskPoolExecutor stealingExecutor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(workStealingPool);
```

#### Pool Lifecycle Management

Proper pool shutdown is critical to prevent resource leaks:

**Graceful Shutdown**

```java
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("MyPool");

try {
    // Create and run tasks
    TimedTask task1 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> work1()).build();
    TimedTask task2 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> work2()).build();

    task1.start();
    task2.start();

    // ... application logic ...

} finally {
    // Stop all tasks
    task1.stop(); // IMPORTANT
    task2.stop(); // IMPORTANT

    // Shutdown the pool
    executor.shutdown();

    // Optionally wait for termination
    boolean terminated = executor.awaitTermination(Duration.ofSeconds(30));
    if (!terminated) {
        System.err.println("Pool did not terminate within timeout");
    }
}
```

**Forceful Shutdown**

```java
TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor("MyPool");

try {
    // Create and run tasks
    TimedTask task1 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> work1()).build();
    TimedTask task2 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> work2()).build();

    task1.start();
    task2.start();

    // ... application logic ...

} finally {
    // task1.stop(); // CAN BE SKIPPED
    // task2.stop(); // CAN BE SKIPPED

    // Shutdown the pool forcefully
    executor.shutdownNow();
}
```

### Memory Considerations

TimedTask is designed with memory efficiency in mind, but long-running tasks require careful attention to prevent memory leaks.

#### Understanding Memory Retention

Memory leaks in TimedTask typically occur through:

1. **Strong references in task closures**: Tasks capture external objects
2. **Long-lived task instances**: Tasks that run indefinitely
3. **Accumulated state**: Data that grows over time within tasks
4. **External object retention**: Tasks holding references to large objects

#### The Strong Reference Problem

**Problem Example:**

```java
public class ServiceManager {
    private LargeDataService dataService = new LargeDataService(); // Large object

    public void startMonitoring() {
        TimedTask monitor = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
            // This closure captures 'this', which includes dataService
            dataService.checkHealth();
        })
        .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .build();

        monitor.start();

        // Even if we set dataService = null later, the task still holds a reference!
        // Memory leak: dataService cannot be garbage collected while task runs
    }
}
```

**Why This Happens:**

The task lambda captures the enclosing `ServiceManager` instance (`this`), creating a strong reference chain:
```
TimedTask → Task Lambda → ServiceManager → dataService
```

As long as the `TimedTask` is running, `this` `ServiceManager` instance remains in memory, even if no longer needed elsewhere.

#### Solution 1: Weak References

Use `WeakReference` to allow garbage collection:

```java
public class ServiceManager {
    private LargeDataService dataService = new LargeDataService();

    public void startMonitoring() {
        // Create weak reference to allow GC
        WeakReference<LargeDataService> serviceRef = new WeakReference<>(dataService);

        TimedTask monitor = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
            LargeDataService service = serviceRef.get();
            if (service != null) {
                service.checkHealth();
            } else {
                // Service was garbage collected
                System.out.println("Service no longer available, stopping monitor");
                t.stop();  // Stop task when service is gone
            }
        })
        .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .build();

        monitor.start();

        // Now dataService can be GC'd when no longer needed
        // Task will detect this and stop itself
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Allows large objects to be garbage collected
- Task can detect when referenced object is gone
- Prevents memory leaks in long-running tasks

#### Solution 2: Static Methods or Separate Classes

Avoid capturing the enclosing instance by using static methods:

```java
public class ServiceManager {
    private LargeDataService dataService = new LargeDataService();

    public void startMonitoring() {
        // Pass only what's needed, not the entire 'this'
        String serviceId = dataService.getId();

        TimedTask monitor = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
            // This doesn't capture ServiceManager instance
            MonitoringUtils.checkHealth(serviceId);
        })
        .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .build();

        monitor.start();
    }
}

class MonitoringUtils {
    static void checkHealth(String serviceId) {
        // Lookup service by ID, or work with minimal data
        // No strong reference to ServiceManager
    }
}
```

#### Memory-Safe Patterns

**Pattern 1: Minimal Capture**

```java
// BAD: Captures entire object
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    this.processAllData();  // Captures 'this'
}).build();

// GOOD: Capture only what's needed
String data = this.data;
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    process(data);  // Captures only 'data' string
}).build();
```

**Pattern 2: Weak Reference with Cleanup**

```java
WeakReference<HeavyResource> resourceRef = new WeakReference<>(heavyResource);
AtomicBoolean cleanedUp = new AtomicBoolean(false);

TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    HeavyResource resource = resourceRef.get();

    if (resource == null && !cleanedUp.getAndSet(true)) {
        System.out.println("Resource GC'd, performing cleanup");
        performCleanup();
        t.stop();
    } else if (resource != null) {
        resource.doWork();
    }
}).setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(10)).build();
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Avoid Strong References in Tasks

**Problem**: Task lambdas can inadvertently capture large objects, preventing garbage collection and causing memory leaks.

#### Why This Matters

When you create a task lambda inside a class, the lambda implicitly captures `this`, creating a strong reference to the enclosing instance. If the task runs for a long time, this prevents the entire object (and everything it references) from being garbage collected.

#### Best Practice: Use Weak References

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Use WeakReference for large objects
public class DataService {
    private byte[] largeDataBuffer = new byte[100_000_000];

    public void startMonitoring() {
        // Create weak reference to allow GC
        WeakReference<DataService> serviceRef = new WeakReference<>(this);

        TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
            DataService service = serviceRef.get();
            if (service != null) {
                service.checkStatus();
            } else {
                // Service was GC'd, stop the task
                System.out.println("Service no longer available");
                t.stop();
            }
        }).setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(1)).build();

        task.start();
        // largeDataBuffer can now be GC'd when service instance is no longer needed
    }
}
```

#### Best Practice: Extract Minimal Data

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Capture only what's needed
public class DataService {
    private byte[] largeDataBuffer = new byte[100_000_000];
    private String serviceId;

    public void startMonitoring() {
        // Extract only the ID, not the entire object
        String id = this.serviceId;

        TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
            // Only 'id' is captured, not 'this'
            checkStatusById(id);
        }).setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(1)).build();

        task.start();
    }

    private static void checkStatusById(String id) {
        // Static method doesn't require instance
    }
}
```

#### Checklist

- [ ] Review task lambdas for implicit `this` captures
- [ ] Use `WeakReference` for large objects in long-running tasks
- [ ] Extract only necessary data before creating task
- [ ] Consider static methods to avoid instance capture
- [ ] Add task timeout/self-stop logic for finite lifetimes

### 2. Proper Resource Cleanup

**Problem**: Failing to stop tasks and shutdown executors causes resource leaks and prevents clean application shutdown.

#### Why This Matters

Running tasks hold threads and other resources. Without proper cleanup:
- JVM may not exit (non-daemon threads keep it alive)
- Memory leaks from accumulated task state
- Thread pool resources remain allocated
- Application shutdown hangs or times out

#### Best Practice: Stop Tasks Explicitly

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Store reference and stop when done
public class DataProcessor {
    private TimedTask processingTask;

    public void start() {
        processingTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> processData())
            .setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
            .build();

        processingTask.start();
    }

    public void stop() {
        if (processingTask != null) {
            processingTask.stop();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Best Practice: Use Try-Finally or Try-With-Resources Pattern

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Ensure cleanup with try-finally
public void runProcessing() {
    TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> process()).build();

    try {
        task.start();
        // Application logic
        doWork();
    } finally {
        // Guaranteed cleanup
        task.stop();
    }
}
```

#### Checklist

- [ ] Every started task has a clear stop point
- [ ] Pool executors are shutdown when application terminates
- [ ] Use try-finally for guaranteed cleanup
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown with timeouts
- [ ] Consider shutdown hooks for non deamon threads
- [ ] Test shutdown scenarios (normal exit, interruption, errors)

### 3. Choosing Between Periodic and Repetitive

**Problem**: Using the wrong execution mode can cause overlapping executions, timing drift, or inefficient resource usage.

#### Understanding the Difference

**Periodic (Fixed-Rate)**:
- Schedules based on **start time** of executions
- Maintains consistent rate over time
- Executions may overlap if duration > period
- No drift accumulation

**Repetitive (Fixed-Delay)**:
- Schedules based on **completion time** of executions
- Guarantees delay between executions
- No overlapping executions
- May drift over long periods

#### When to Use Periodic (Fixed-Rate)

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Periodic for fast, predictable tasks
TimedTask healthCheck = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // Fast check: 10-50ms
    boolean healthy = checkServiceHealth();
    logHealth(healthy);
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
.build();

// Result: Checks run exactly every 30 seconds
// 00:00, 00:30, 01:00, 01:30, ...
```

**Use periodic when**:
- Task execution is fast (< 10% of period)
- Consistent timing is important
- You need predictable scheduling (e.g., "every 5 minutes")
- Task should run at specific intervals regardless of duration
- Occasional overlaps are acceptable

#### When to Use Repetitive (Fixed-Delay)

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Repetitive for variable-duration tasks
TimedTask batchProcessor = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // Variable duration: 100ms to 10 seconds
    processBatchFromQueue();  // Duration depends on batch size
})
.setRepetetiveDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
.build();

// Result: 5-second rest between batches, no overlaps
```

**Use repetitive when**:
- Task execution time is variable or unpredictable
- Tasks must not overlap
- You need guaranteed rest period between executions
- Task duration may occasionally exceed desired period
- System needs time to recover/cool down between runs

#### Comparison Example

```java
// PERIODIC: May overlap if processing is slow
TimedTask periodicTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    Thread.sleep(7000);  // Task takes 7 seconds
})
.setPeriodicDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))  // But period is 5 seconds
.build();
// Result: Multiple tasks run simultaneously!
// Time:  0s   5s   7s   10s  12s  15s  17s
// Exec:  [----X----]
//             [----X----]
//                  [----X----]
//                       [----X----]
// (overlapping executions)

// REPETITIVE: Never overlaps
TimedTask repetitiveTask = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    Thread.sleep(7000);  // Task takes 7 seconds
})
.setRepetetiveDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(5))  // 5 seconds after completion
.build();
// Result: Tasks never overlap
// Time:  0s   7s   12s  19s  24s
// Exec:  [----X----]    [----X----]
//                 ^5s^        ^5s^
// (guaranteed 5-second gap)
```

#### Decision Tree

```
Is task duration predictable and fast?
├─ YES: Use PERIODIC
│   └─ Fast, consistent scheduling
│
└─ NO: Can task duration exceed period?
    ├─ YES: Use REPETITIVE (prevent overlaps)
    │   └─ Safe, no resource contention
    │
    └─ NO: Either works, prefer PERIODIC
        └─ More predictable timing
```

#### Checklist

- [ ] Measured typical and maximum task execution time
- [ ] Chosen mode appropriate for task characteristics
- [ ] Considered impact of potential overlaps (periodic)
- [ ] Documented why mode was chosen
- [ ] Tested with realistic workloads

### 4. Thread Pool vs Individual Threads

**Problem**: Choosing the wrong executor type can lead to resource exhaustion or unnecessary overhead.

#### Understanding the Tradeoff

**TimedTaskThreadExecutor** (Individual Threads):
- ✅ Complete task isolation
- ✅ Simple resource model
- ✅ Easy debugging (clear thread names)
- ❌ More threads (mitigated by virtual threads)

**TimedTaskPoolExecutor** (Shared Pool):
- ✅ Bounded resource usage
- ✅ Thread reuse efficiency
- ✅ Centralized management
- ❌ Tasks can affect each others performance
- ❌ More complex configuration

#### When to Use TimedTaskThreadExecutor

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Thread executor for isolated, long-running tasks
TimedTaskThreadExecutor executor = new TimedTaskThreadExecutor();

TimedTask task1 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // This task needs isolation
    performCriticalOperation();
}).setName("CriticalTask").build();

TimedTask task2 = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    // This task has different thread requirements
    performBackgroundWork();
}).setName("BackgroundTask").build();
```

**Use thread executor when**:
- You have relatively few tasks (< 100)
- Tasks need complete isolation
- Tasks have different thread requirements (priority, daemon status)
- Debugging is important (named threads help)
- Using virtual threads (default) – lightweight and efficient
- Each task needs its own dedicated resources

#### When to Use TimedTaskPoolExecutor

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Pool executor for many similar tasks
CustomThreadPool pool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setMinThreads(4)
    .setMaxThreads(20)
    .setName("TaskPool")
    .build();

TimedTaskPoolExecutor executor = new TimedTaskPoolExecutor(pool);

// Create many tasks sharing the pool
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
        processItem(i);
    }).build();
    task.start();
}
```

**Use pool executor when**:
- You have many tasks (> 20)
- Resource limits are important
- Tasks are similar in nature
- Memory efficiency is a priority
- You need centralized thread management
- Platform threads are required (not virtual)

#### Configuration Guidelines

**For Thread Executor:**
```java
TimedTaskThreadExecutor executor = new TimedTaskThreadExecutor();

// Default (virtual threads) is usually best
// Only customize if you need specific thread properties:
if (needsPlatformThreads) {
    ThreadFactory factory = r -> {
        Thread thread = new Thread(r);
        thread.setDaemon(true);
        thread.setPriority(Thread.HIGH_PRIORITY);
        return thread;
    };
    executor.setThreadFactory(factory);
}
```

**For Pool Executor:**
```java
// Configure based on workload characteristics
CustomThreadPool pool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setMinThreads(cpuCores)              // For CPU-bound tasks
    .setMaxThreads(cpuCores * 2)          // Reasonable upper bound
    .setIdleTime(Duration.ofMinutes(5))   // Keep threads longer for steady load
    .setName("WorkerPool")
    .build();

// Or for I/O-bound tasks:
CustomThreadPool ioPool = CustomThreadPool.builder()
    .setMinThreads(0)                     // Scale down when idle
    .setMaxThreads(100)                   // Can have many waiting for I/O
    .setIdleTime(Duration.ofSeconds(60))  // Quick scale-down
    .setName("IOPool")
    .build();
```

#### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Executor Type | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| < 20 tasks | Thread Executor | Overhead is minimal, simplicity wins |
| > 100 tasks | Pool Executor | Resource efficiency matters |
| CPU-bound tasks | Pool Executor | Limit to CPU core count |
| I/O-bound tasks | Thread Executor (virtual) | Lightweight, no contention |
| Mixed workload | Both | Separate critical from background |
| Development | Thread Executor | Easier debugging |
| Production | Pool Executor | Predictable resource usage |

#### Checklist

- [ ] Counted expected number of concurrent tasks
- [ ] Identified task characteristics (CPU/I/O-bound)
- [ ] Chosen executor type based on workload
- [ ] Configured pool size appropriately (if using pool)
- [ ] Documented executor choice reasoning
- [ ] Load tested with realistic task counts

### 5. Naming Tasks

**Problem**: Unnamed tasks make debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting difficult.

#### Best Practice: Always Name Production Tasks

```java
// ✅ GOOD: Named task
TimedTask task = executor.createTimedTask(t -> {
    processData();
})
.setName("DataProcessor")
.build();
// Thread names: "[DataProcessor]Timer", "[DataProcessor]Task#1"
// (immediately clear what each thread does!)
```
